response: Please be aware that this word or phrase originated as part of African American Vernacular English (AAVE), colloquially referred to as ebonics. In general, we recommend avoiding AAVE to prevent appropriation of black culture. However, as most languages do, many words from this vernacular have spread into common English communication. If you are African American, or for some other reason feel comfortable using AAVE, you may opt out of this category at any time by messaging me "opt out aave"
